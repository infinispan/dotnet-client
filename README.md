# C# Hot Rod Client #

## Build ##
Build prerequisites:

* C++ HotRod Client (www.infinispan.org/hotrod-clients/)
* CMake 3.x (www.cmake.org)
* C++11
* SWIG 2.0.x (http://www.swig.org)
* .NET Framework 4.5
* NLog 2.1.0 (http://nlog-project.org/)
* NUnit 2.6.3 (https://launchpad.net/nunitv2)
* IKVM.NET 8.1.5717.0 (http://www.ikvm.net/)

Note: after unpacking IKVM please edit the .exe.config files in <ikvm-root>/bin
and comment-out the "\<supportedRuntime version="v2.0.50727"/\>" element from all
of them.

Documentation building requirements:
* Doxygen (http://doxygen.org)

Package building requirements:
* WiX (http://wixtoolset.org)

After you install the dependencies please update the PATH environment
variable to include the bin/ directories of CMake, SWIG, Maven, NUnit, IKVM.

Build steps:

    set NLOG_DLL=/path/to/nlog/2.1.0/dll
    set NUNIT_DLL=/path/to/nunit.framework.dll
    
    set HOTRODCPP32_HOME=/path/to/native/32bit/client
    set HOTRODCPP64_HOME=/path/to/native/64bit/client
    
    set HOTROD_SNK=/path/to/key/to/be/generated
    sn.exe -k %HOTROD_SNK%

    set JBOSS_HOME=/path/to/hotrod/standalone/server

By default the build script will run the unit/integrations tests. If
you want to disable them pass ENABLE_{JAVA,CSHARP}_TESTING=false as flags
on the command line:

    build.bat [-DENABLE_JAVA_TESTING=false] [-DENABLE_CSHARP_TESTING=false]

Any additional build.bat arguments you might add will be passed on to cmake
during the build script generation phase.

After the script completes successfully you can find the .msi installer in
the build_windows/ subdirectory.

Optionally you can build a bundle to include the .NET and C++ runtimes which are
project dependencies.

Important: Make sure the runtimes to be bundled match the ones used for the actual build!

To build the bundle define:

    set HOTROD_VCREDIST_x86=<path to vcredist_x86.exe>
    set HOTROD_VCREDIST_x64=<path to vcredist_x64.exe>
    set HOTROD_DOTNET=<path to the .NET runtime standalone installer>

and then pass -DHOTROD_BUILD_BUNDLE=true on the command line as argument to build.bat. After
the build is complete you cand find the package in build_windows/ with a name ending in
"-bundle.exe".

Support for building the client using Mono (http://www.mono-project.com) will
be coming soon.
