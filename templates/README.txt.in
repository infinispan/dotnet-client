* C# Hot Rod Client
  
  C# client for Infinispan, over the Hot Rod [1] wire protocol.
  Released under Apache License, Version 2.0.

* Package structure

  The lib/ directory contains the .NET client DLL (hotrodcs.dll) and
  API documentation for it for use in the IDE (hotrodcs.xml).

  The API documentation in HTML format is available in the docs/api
  subdirectory and you can also find further info in the Infinispan
  Documentation [2].

  In addition to the .NET client the lib/ directory contains other
  DLLs which are used by the client as dependecies (native client and
  wrappers over it and NLog).

* Contributing back

  Contributions, as always, are welcomed be it in the form of code,
  tests or documentation.

* Source code

  This client, along with tests and documentation, are in GitHub
  [3]. Feel free to fork and issue pull requests on changes. For more
  information on working with this repository and GitHub, refer to the
  Contributing Guide [4] for Infinispan.
