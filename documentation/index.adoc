== Introduction
Since HotRod is a binary, language neutral, protocol an Infinispan client can
use any programming language to interact with Java based Infinispan HotRod
server as long as client APIs exist for that particular client runtime. C#
HotRod client allows .NET applications to connect and interact with an
Infinispan Hot Rod server.

The client is built as a wrapper over the native C++ HotRod client which
comes bundled in the install package (both 32 and 64 bit versions) and it
supports L1, L2 and L3 intelligence levels.

== Installation
=== Pre-requisites
The .NET Framework 4.0 is required for using the client.

=== Download
You can find the MSI package on the HotRod Clients
link:http://infinispan.org/hotrod-clients[download] page.

== Usage
=== Configuration
The client configuration is done programmatically using the ConfigurationBuilder.

The main thing you need to configure is the host and port to which the client
should connect. In the example below the builder uses the values passed as
command line arguments if they are present.

There are many more things which can be configured using the builder. Please
refer to the API documentation of ConfigurationBuilder for details (the API
documentation is bundled with the client).

.Example.cs
----
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Infinispan.HotRod;
using Infinispan.HotRod.Config;

namespace simpleapp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            ConfigurationBuilder builder = new ConfigurationBuilder();
            builder.AddServer()
                .Host(args.Length > 1 ? args[0] : "127.0.0.1")
                .Port(args.Length > 2 ? int.Parse(args[1]) : 11222);

            Configuration config = builder.Build();

            RemoteCacheManager cacheManager = new RemoteCacheManager(config);

            [...]
        }
    }
}
----


=== API
Once the cache manager is configured you can used it to retrive references
to the caches available on the server. In the example below the default
cache is retrived from the server and a few basic operations are performed
on it.

For more details please have a look at the RemoteCacheManager and IRemoteCache
API documentation.

.Example.cs
----
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Infinispan.HotRod;
using Infinispan.HotRod.Config;

namespace simpleapp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            ConfigurationBuilder builder = new ConfigurationBuilder();
            builder.AddServer()
                .Host(args.Length > 1 ? args[0] : "127.0.0.1")
                .Port(args.Length > 2 ? int.Parse(args[1]) : 11222);

            Configuration config = builder.Build();

            RemoteCacheManager cacheManager = new RemoteCacheManager(config);
            cacheManager.Start();

            // Retrieve a reference to the default cache.
            IRemoteCache<String, String> cache = cacheManager.GetCache<String, String>();

            // Add entries.
            cache.Put("key1", "value1");

            cache.PutIfAbsent("key1", "anotherValue1");
            cache.PutIfAbsent("key2", "value2");
            cache.PutIfAbsent("key3", "value3");

            // Retrive entries.
            Console.WriteLine("key1 -> " + cache.Get("key1"));

            // Bulk retrieve key/value pairs.
            int limit = 10;
            IDictionary<String, String> result = cache.GetBulk(limit);
            foreach (KeyValuePair<String, String> kv in result)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(kv.Key + " -> " + kv.Value);
            }

            // Remove entries.
            cache.Remove("key2");
            Console.WriteLine("key2 -> " + cache.Get("key2"));

            cacheManager.Stop();
        }
    }
}
